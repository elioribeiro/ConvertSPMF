Steps for Executing the Algorithm

1 - The file createGraphs receives an OCEL and converts it into object graphs;
2 - The file convertSPMF receives the OCEL and the name of the output file to be used in the SPMF tool. Additionally, it reads the file generated in step 1, and at the end, it generates the file that will be used as input in the SPMF tool; 
3 - The file from step 2 is used as input in the SPMF tool (https://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/);
4 - The file calculateMeasures is responsible for calculating the measures that SPMF does not calculate, such as sup(A), sup(B), Lift. As input, this file receives the file generated in step 2 and the file generated by the SPMF tool, and in the end, it outputs a file containing the rules and their measures of interest
5 - The file reducingTheNumberOfRules applies filters to reduce the number of rules. It takes as input the file generated in step 3 and the measurements generated in step 4;
6 - The file greedyOptimizationRules performs an optimization process to find the smallest set of rules that contain all the activities from the rules provided in step 5, which serve as its input;
